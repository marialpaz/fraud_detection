# Table of contents
## 1. Introduction
In this project was used a Credit Card Transactions dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains credit card transactions data for a period of two days of european clients from September, 2013.

### Goal of the project : 
Create a model with a good performance in the detection of fraudulent transactions.

## The Dataset
This dataset has 284807 entries and its features are describe below.

**Amount**: the transaction amount.

**Class** : tells us if that certain transaction is a fraud or not, where 1 = fraud and 0 = not a fraud.
